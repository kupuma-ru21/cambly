The topic is about four day workweek.
An article I read notes about it.
In brief, four day workweek seems to have a variety of good effects.
For instance, employees work on four day workweek basis said they can feel less stress.
Also sick days apparently is decreasing.
In addition, probability of employees quitting has reduced.
I considerably approve of the work style because I can get more time spent on studying English.
What do you think about it?

It is more easier for freelancer to work on four day work basis
but only competent workers could conduct it.

A company which offers four day work week would attract more applicants
so the company wouldn't struggle to recruit.

Depending on the case, a company would pay less salary to its employees who hope it.
Therefore, the company would secure its more funds.

I worked as a full-time worker about two years ago.
The company I worked struggled to contain turnover of its employees.

The company I worked struggled to contain turnover of its employees.

Probably many Japanese companies would adopt it
but that would be later than other countries such as the U.S, European ones and so on.

I think five day work is unbalanced because we couldn't take a rest for just two days.
