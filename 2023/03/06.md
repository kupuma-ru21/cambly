The topic is about a cafe.
I learned of late Starbucks introduces olive oil coffee.
That it interesting.
I worked at a store of Starbucks and as a result I'm attached to it.
But smoking isn't prohibited in it so I often another cafe which allows it rather than Starbucks.
However olive oil coffee attracts me and therefore I will try to drink it.
Do you often visit Starbucks?
Or Do you like another cafe apart from it.
