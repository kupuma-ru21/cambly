The topic is about four day workweek.
An article I read notes about it.
In brief, four day workweek gives rise to variety of good effects.
For instance, employees work on four day workweek basis said they can feel less stress.
Also sick days apparently is decreasing.
In addition, probability of employees quitting has reduced.
I considerably approve of the work style because I get more time spent on studying English.
What do you think about it?
