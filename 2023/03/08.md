The topic is healthy foods.
I heard interesting information.
Mcdonald's has announced it is introducing meat-free McNuggets in Germany.
They are apparently made from peas, corn and so on.
I like a meal of it and as a result I often go to it.

Do you have anythings you pay attention to in your diet?
