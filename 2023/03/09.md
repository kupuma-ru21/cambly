The topic is wisdom teeth.
Thought some people including me don't need it, it exists.
On the other hand, a little more than half of people get their wisdom teeth at all.
I had my some wisdom teeth removed last year but I couldn't be substantially bothered.
It seems to be needed in the past because our ancestors had to eat tough foods.
However now that we eat softer ones, our jaws are more smaller.
Consequently, it may cause pain to grow in our mouth.
Did you have it or do you pay attention to dental treatments?

I recognize it as merit that I can pay rent as expense.
