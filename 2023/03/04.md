The is about risk of dependence to just one.
I learned Portugal banned operation of Airbnbs and will end Portugal's "golden visa" program.
Portugal has reportedly faced housing crisis
and have preferred its citizens to live in house in it rather than immigrants to do so.
Consequently, it is taking those actions.
In my opinion, these actions would cause more worse effects than housing crisis because empty housing rapidly emerge and the problem would be more serious than housing crisis.
What do you think about it?
