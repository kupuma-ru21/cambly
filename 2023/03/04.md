The topic is about state policy.
I learned Portugal banned operation of Airbnbs and will end Portugal's "golden visa" program.
Portugal has reportedly faced housing crisis
and have preferred its citizens to live in house in it rather than immigrants to do so.
Consequently, it is taking those actions.
In my opinion, the measures would cause more worse effects than housing crisis
because empty housing would rapidly emerge and the problem would be more serious than it.
What do you think about it?

I hope it will lower.
It is time soon cherry blossom picnic took place in my country.
We haven't held any events under the cherry blossoms for three consecutive years/three years straight.
As far as I know, there is only one type of cherry tree.
