The topic is wisdom teeth.
Thought some people including me don't need it, it exists for some reason.
On the other hand, a little more than half of people get their wisdom teeth at all.
I had my some wisdom teeth removed last year but I couldn't be substantially bothered.
It seems to be needed in the past because our ancestors had to eat tough foods.
However now that we eat softer ones, our jaws are more smaller.
Consequently, it may cause pain to grow in our mouth.
Did you have it?

The topic is about Mars.
According to NASA, it was revealed Mars were once covered by water.
Also it predicted microbes could exist billions of years ago.
Though I'm not familiar with that,
I guess NASA has carried out exploration to confirm
whether human beings could live in Mars in the event of the worst in the earth.
In my opinion, that is important but we should be environmentally friendly for the earth before that.
However I understand it would be difficult to improve environment of it.
What do you think about it?
