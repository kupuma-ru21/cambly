The topic is about Mars.
According to NASA, it was revealed Mars were once covered by water.
Also it predicted microbes could exist billions of years ago.
Though I'm not familiar with that,
I guess NASA has carried out exploration to confirm
whether human beings could live in Mars in the event of the worst in the earth.
In my opinion, that is important but we should be environmentally friendly for the earth before that.
However I understand it would be difficult to improve environment of it.
What do you think about it?

The topic is about Tiktok.
Though I haven't ever used it, I know it it famous.
In my opinion, many teenagers should use it.
I browsed an interesting article about it.
The article noted relatively many governments have banned the use of it on any device issued by them.
For example, the U.S, Canada, India, Taiwan, EU and so on.
They have concerns about confidentiality of privacy on TikTok.
After I read it, I guess people at large shouldn't use it to secure their personal information.
Do you use it?

The topic is about moving back in with parents.
An article I read noted that may improve well being according to a research.
Especially young people between 21 and 35 ages.
I sympathize with that because I occasionally go to my parents home.
However that would be worse than living independently in accordance with another research.
I can understand that
because if I live in my parents' home I couldn't concentrate on learning English.
Consequently, in my opinion it would be the best to return to it on occasion.
