The topic is new line of McDonald's.
I heard interesting information about that.
It has announced that it is introducing meat-free McNuggets in Germany.
They are apparently made from peas, corn and so on.
I like a meal of it and as a result I often go to it.
However I'm aware of not taking calory too much.
Consequently, I'm looking forward to them to be marketed to my country.
Do you often take out at McDonald's?

The topic is wisdom teeth.
Thought some people including me don't need it, it exists for some reason.
On the other hand, a little more than half of people get their wisdom teeth at all.
I had my some wisdom teeth removed last year but I couldn't be substantially bothered.
It seems to be needed in the past because our ancestors had to eat tough foods.
However now that we eat softer ones, our jaws are more smaller.
Consequently, it may cause pain to grow in our mouth.
Did you have it?
