The topic is about four day workweek.
An article I read notes about it.
In brief, four day workweek seems to have a variety of good effects.
For instance, employees work on four day workweek basis said they can feel less stress.
Also sick days apparently is decreasing.
In addition, probability of employees quitting has reduced.
I considerably approve of the work style because I can get more time spent on studying English.
What do you think about it?

The topic is new line of McDonald's.
I heard interesting information about that.
It has announced that it is introducing meat-free McNuggets in Germany.
They are apparently made from peas, corn and so on.
I like a meal of it and as a result I often go to it.
However I'm aware of not taking calory too much.
Consequently, I'm looking forward to them to be marketed to my country.
Do you often take out at McDonald's?
